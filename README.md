# Vanilla Factions Expanded Insectoids

Vanilla Factions Expanded - Insectoids is a long awaited module for Vanilla Factions Expanded. 
Focused entirely on the insectoid hive, this mini-expansion introduces new threats in the form of the ever growing hive of deadly insects, a large selection of long forgotten archotech artifacts as well as a way to genetically engineer new, deadly creatures.
